In this article, I’ll explore what programmers use indentation for, the advantages and disadvantages of indenting with tabs or spaces alone, and why mixing them is the best, if not objectively correct, way to indent. I am certainly not the first to make this claim, and I’m sure I won’t be the last. But this point is far from moot; many, many, many, MANY people still advocate using a fixed number of spaces. This article will show why they are wrong. Unless you’re using a language with whitespace-based syntax — the most notorious example of which is Python — your code will run just fine no matter how it’s indented. So why indent at all? When writing code, indentation is used to accomplish two goals: It makes the structure of your code, as a computer would see it, clear to a human as well; when code is indented correctly, the hierarchical relation between statements and scopes is visible on the screen. This way, you and the computer agree on the structure of the code. We will refer to indentation used this way as semantic indentation. An example of semantic indentation is below. All examples in this article will be in JavaScript, but the principles apply to every language.[1] // The initial indent level is 0 function f(x, y) { // We're inside the function, so we indent one level if (x) { // Now we're inside the `if-elseif-else`, so we indent one additional level } else if (y) { // Still inside `if-elseif-else` for (let i = 0; i another indent console.log(`Logged ${i+1} times`); } } else { // Still inside... } // Now we're not, so we go back to the function-level indent } // And now we're outside the function again, so back to 0 It is used for typesetting/alignment. This is most useful when when items that are part of a single statement have to be displayed over multiple lines and you wish to horizontally align the lower items with the first item. We will refer to indentation used this way as aesthetic indentation. Below is an example of this kind of indentation with two equivalent styles shown. Style 1: operators at the start of the line if (superLongConditionNumber1 && superLongConditionNumber2 && superLongConditionNumber3) { /* Do stuff */ } Style 2: operators at the end of the line if (superLongConditionNumber1 && superLongConditionNumber2 && superLongConditionNumber3) { /* Do stuff */ } In both styles​[2], the conditions in the if statement are all aligned to the same column, column 4. When everything is in the same place on each line, the code becomes much easier to parse quickly; it’s almost like you’re looking at a table of text instead of lines of text. For alignment to work consistently, it’s imperative that you use a monospace font — a font in which every character has the same width (as opposed to a variable-width font). Otherwise the alignment will be sensitive to the relative widths of the characters, and thus will break if you switch fonts. In this article, all the code blocks are written with a monospace font, a custom variant of Iosevka. So, what happens when you need to mix both styles of indentation? What happens when, on a single line, you need to use both semantic indentation and aesthetic indentation? Can this situation even occur naturally? (Yes.) Before we talk about that, we should discuss what indentation actually is. The tab key, Tab, can trace its history back to the tab stop on typewriters. On a typewriter, tab stops were used to create fixed horizontal positions for the carriage (the part that holds the paper and moves horizontally as you type) to travel to. This was useful when typing tabular data — hence the name tab stop — as once you had placed tab stops at the start of each of the table’s columns, you could quickly advance from one column to the next by pressing the Tab key.[3] This was faster and more reliable than pressing the space key as many times as necessary to advance to the next column. (When you were done with the last column on the line, instead of pressing Tab you would pull the carriage return lever to move to the next line and return the carriage to the leftmost position.) When computers began to replace typewriters, the Tab key kept the same behavior: advancing to the next preset location on the line. The question was: what is the right way to implement this behavior in a virtual text field? Wite-Out notwithstanding, typewritten text is a write-once format, so when advancing the carriage there was no difference between using tab stops and repeatedly pressing the space bar; tab stops just made advancing the carriage more consistent and convenient. But computers allow text to be edited (duh), so when people started using them, the question of how a computer should store the fact that the Tab key was pressed needed to be settled. Should it simulate pressing space enough times to move over to the next virtual tab stop — say, some multiple of eight characters from the start of the line? Well, if spaces were inserted, then if any edits were made to the previous text on the line, subsequent tab stops would become misaligned and the user would have to manually correct the number of spaces inserted. This wouldn’t do; computers are supposed to automate this kind of boring work for us. Instead, the answer was the tab character, U+0009, often represented in source code as \\t. Throughout this article, I will refer to this character as .[4] Throughout this article, within code blocks, ⤓ will represent tab stops, · will represent space between tab stops, ├╌┤ will represent a tab character (of variable width), and ␣ will represent a single space character. Due to this representation of the character, we will have to represent tabs of width 1 as ║, and tabs of width 0 as single line behind the previous character, e.g., a. The beauty of the character, as opposed to using several spaces, is that the computer can dynamically set its width so that it always appears to fill the horizontal space to the next virtual tab stop. When text to the left of a character is edited, the computer can immediately resize the character on the fly so that it is always flush with a tab stop. In other words, if you use to enter tabular data laid out in columns, the alignment of the columns will be preserved even as the content of the table changes. For instance, if tab stops are set to multiples of eight characters, then the following shows how will change widths to maintain the columns. ·······⤓·······⤓ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤ a├╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤ ab├╌╌╌╌┤x├╌╌╌╌╌┤ abc├╌╌╌┤xy├╌╌╌╌┤ abcd├╌╌┤xyz├╌╌╌┤ In this example, we chose a tab width of eight characters. This decision was arbitrary; let’s see what happens if we’d instead chosen a tab width of four characters. ···⤓···⤓ ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤ a├╌┤├╌╌┤ ab├┤x├╌┤ abc║xy├┤ abcdxyz║ Looks good, although in the last row we ran out of space between the columns. What about a width of two characters? ·⤓·⤓·⤓·⤓ ├┤├┤ a║├┤ abx║ abc║xy abcdxyz║ Whoops! Our tab stops weren’t wide enough — they were only two spaces wide, but we tried to insert four characters in one column — so things got misaligned. But as long as the tab stop width is at least the width of the widest column of text entered within a column, everything works out. So, if you’re entering data in columns, how wide should tab stops be? Eight characters? Four? Two? (One?) It depends on how wide you expect your columns to be. But when indenting code, there is by definition no text within the indentation; it’s all whitespace. There is no minimum tab width; regardless of the tab width you choose, the (whitespace-only) columns will remain aligned. This means that the consideration of how wide to make the tab stops that comprise the indentation in your editor is immaterial. It is completely up to your personal preference. Which of the following styles do you prefer? function f() { if (foo) { bar() } } function f() { if (foo) { bar() } } It’s entirely a matter of preference; both options perfectly preserve the alignment of the whitespace columns. Alice and Bob are working on the same codebase. Having read the above, they decide that from here on out, they will only use to indent their code. That way they can each read each other’s code with the indent width that they prefer. ·······⤓·······⤓ // Alice prefers a tab width of 8 function f() { ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤if (foo) { ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤bar() ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤} } ···⤓···⤓ // Bob prefers a tab width of 4 function f() { ├╌╌┤if (foo) { ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤bar() ├╌╌┤} } Looks great! Crucially, these two code snippets have the same underlying representation — they are byte-for-byte equal. Yet when Alice and Bob open this file on their own computer, they each get to see the code how they prefer. Same file, different appearance — that’s the magic of the tab character. Unfortunately, Alice and Bob run into a little bit of a wrinkle. Bob checks in the following code: ···⤓···⤓ function f() { ├╌╌┤if (superLongConditionNumber1 ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤&& superLongConditionNumber2 ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤&& superLongConditionNumber3) ├╌╌┤{ ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤/* Do stuff */ ├╌╌┤} } He is proud of how nicely aligned his code is; having the three condition lines aligned inside the if's parentheses looks great. But soon afterward, Alice complains to him about how poorly aligned his code is. Bob is confused — the code looked great on his computer. But when he views his code on Alice’s computer, he sees the issue: ·······⤓·······⤓ function f() { ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤if (superLongConditionNumber1 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤&& superLongConditionNumber2 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤&& superLongConditionNumber3) ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤{ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤/* Do stuff */ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤} } Whoops! The if statements conditions lines aren’t aligned anymore. Unfortunately, Bob had meant to push over those condition lines by four characters, but he used s to do it, and so the alignment he was so proud of only existed when using s of width four. Alice’s and Bob’s coworker Simplicio​[5] watches this unfold from a distance. He offers them a solution to their problem: “Just use spaces!”. Alice and Bob look at each other reluctantly, but Simplicio insists that Alice and Bob open his version of the file, shown below, on their computers. ·····⤓·····⤓ function f() { ␣␣␣␣␣␣if (superLongConditionNumber1 ␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber2 ␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber3) ␣␣␣␣␣␣{ ␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣/* Do stuff */ ␣␣␣␣␣␣} } They all agree that no matter whose computer they viewed Simplicio’s version on, it looks the same. Reluctantly, Bob admits that this does fix his alignment problem. But Alice isn’t so sure about Simplicio’s solution. “Wait”, Alice said, “this won’t do.” “The code is aligned, is it not?”, asked Simplicio. “Yes, but Bob and I are stuck with your ugly indentation! I like my indentation to be eight characters, and Bob likes his to be four.” “I’m sorry”, says Simplicio, “but I just don’t see another way to solve this problem. If you want your code to be aligned, you’ll just need to indent with spaces, your preferences be damned.” Sure enough, if they were to continue to use spaces for indentation, they would not each be able to use the indentation width they preferred. It seemed that Simplicio’s “solution” had merely traded one problem for another. “Eureka!”, cries Alice. “I know the solution to this problem. I know how we can each use the indentation width we prefer while keeping our code nicely aligned!” “Impossible”, retorts Simplicio. “Let’s hear her out”, says Bob. Her solution? Use the two kinds of whitespace characters where they each excel. for Semantic Indentation…​ Because the character is flexible, it is perfect for semantic indentation. Its width can be set by each user individually, and so they’ll all view the same file the way they each prefer. And for Aesthetic Indentation Because the character is inflexible, it is perfect for aesthetic indentation. Its width never changes, so the amount of space it adds to aligned text remains the same regardless of who is looking at the file. To test her solution, Alice rewrites the file as such: ·······⤓·······⤓ function f() { ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤if (superLongConditionNumber1 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber2 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber3) ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤{ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤/* Do stuff */ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌┤} } When Bob opens it on his computer, he sees this: ···⤓···⤓ function f() { ├╌╌┤if (superLongConditionNumber1 ├╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber2 ├╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber3) ├╌╌┤{ ├╌╌┤├╌╌┤/* Do stuff */ ├╌╌┤} } It looks like her solution works! Out of spite, Simplicio sets his width to 16. Surely Alice’s solution won’t work then? To his dismay, it does: ···············⤓···············⤓ function f() { ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤if (superLongConditionNumber1 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber2 ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber3) ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤{ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤/* Do stuff */ ├╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌┤} } Finally, in a vain attempt to outsmart Alice’s solution, Simplicio tries setting his width to 1: ⤓⤓ function f() { ║if (superLongConditionNumber1 ║␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber2 ║␣␣␣␣&& superLongConditionNumber3) ║{ ║║/* Do stuff */ ║} } Unsurprisingly, Alice’s solution survives this attack, too. Reluctantly, Simplicio concedes that using for semantic indentation and for aesthetic indentation is the best option after all; it’s the only way to allow Alice, Bob, and anyone else (even Simplicio) to each have the indentation width they prefer without losing the ability to keep code nicely aligned. So, now that we know the right way to indent our code, how can we actually achieve this style of indentation? Don’t! Just give up! Accept that the problem is too hard to solve, settle on only tabs or only spaces, and move on. This is what Python did from the outset​[6], and it doesn’t seem to have hurt it much. In general, imposing your will on others without regard for their individual preferences is the simplest way to get what you want. Who cares if people whose preferences differ from your own aren’t happy with your decision? That’s their problem. The “dumb” way is to manually indent your own code. When you want to increase the scope depth, press Tab (and make sure your editor is set to insert when you do so!). When you want to align some code, press Space as many times as necessary. A bit inconvenient, but it will work just fine. Just make sure not to accidentally tell your editor to convert all indentation to tabs or spaces, as that will undo all your hard work. For every programming language, there is almost certainly some auto-formatter that will nicely format your code for you.[7] Many languages have several. Here are some examples: Python black autopep8 yapf JavaScript Prettier Beautify JavaScript Standard Style Others Go gofmt Rust rustfmt Ruby RuboCop Java google-java-format If this is your first time hearing about auto-formatters, stop reading this article and go install one for a language you work in. You’ll never manually format your code again (which you shouldn’t — tedium is for computers, not humans). Unfortunately, most of these indent with spaces (Camp 1) by default. Gofmt is the only formatter on this list that indents with tabs and spaces (Camp 0) by default, although Rustfmt can also be configured to indent the right way with the non-default option hard_tabs = true. So unfortunately, chances are that if you use an auto-formatter, you’ll be stuck with Simplicio’s indentation scheme; if you want to join Camp 0, you’ll need to format your code the dumb way. To fix this, you can open an issue on the auto-formatter’s repo, or, preferably, submit a pull request that implements this behavior. If you’re lazy, though, you can just post an article online and hope that enough people read it and agree with it that the idea of mixing tabs and spaces becomes mainstream. Thus far, we’ve been focused primarily on the fact that mixed indentation lets programmers express their indentation width preferences while keeping things tidy. But indenting with both s and s has other advantages as well: Sure, some editors have “smart” behavior that allows them to treat multiple spaces as a single tab stop. (It’s dumb that they need a setting at all for something this simple.) But this takes configuring and varies on a per language/filetype basis. And can you guarantee that you’ll always be using your editor of choice? (Imagine having to SSH into a server where the only editor is a config-less Vim — not fun!) If you use s for semantic indentation, everything will just work. If your cursor is within -based indentation, the left and right arrow keys are guaranteed to navigate between tab stops; it’s impossible to move just part of the way to the next tab stop. This lets you move between tab stops more quickly (regardless of any editor settings). It also prevents your cursor from ever being located between tab stops, which would serve no purpose — if it’s between tab stops, the only useful thing for it to do is move somewhere else first. If your cursor is within -based indentation and you attempt to delete a single indent, you…​ successfully delete that indent. (Amazing!) If you are using -based indentation, though, a number of things could happen, depending on your editor’s settings: You might delete a tab stop’s worth of spaces You might delete just a single space If your cursor is not at a tab stop, you might delete back to the previous tab stop, which will be less than a full tab stop away. Why deal with this when there’s a character that was made to indent just begging to be used? Depending on how many s one uses to simulate a , s can take up quite a bit less space in a file. If you could shrink the sizes of all your files by 5% for no cost, wouldn’t you? An unstated premise of this article was that one’s editor should faithfully render one’s files, including whitespace (or the lack thereof). However, auto-formatters are able to infer where whitespace belongs so that they can format the file correctly. Accordingly, it should also be possible for text editors to infer where whitespace belongs. This means that it should be possible, in theory, to insert no indentation whatsoever in one’s source code, and instead make it the responsibility of the text editor to display the file’s (unindented) contents with the correct indentation. What gets saved is this function f(x) { if (x === 1) { console.log(\"x was 1\"); } else { console.log(`x wasn't 1; it was ${x}`) } } But this is what you see and edit function f(x) { if (x === 1) { console.log(\"x was 1\"); } else { console.log(`x wasn't 1; it was ${x}`) } } This would make the whole argument of tabs-versus-spaces-versus-both moot, but would require changing both how editors render it code and how people write it (in the event that they’re not using such an editor). And of course this would not be possible in whitespace-sensitive languages such as Python, nor would it work reliably if your file contained any syntax errors. One interesting consequence of this would be that when using version control, adding or removing a scope would only show up in a diff as just the opening and closing lines being added/removed; the enclosed code would remain unchanged. Taken one step further, one could imagine saving one’s source code in a somewhat minified form (although not completely minified; token names and comments would need to be preserved) which would be expanded to a more easily human-readable and -writable form by the text editor — in the same manner as an auto-formatter, but, as above, without writing this representation to the file. Version control would have to be modified to use semantic diffs instead of line-based diffs (since all the code would be on one line); perhaps it could construct syntax trees from the two versions and then diff the trees. Elastic Tabstops are somewhat tangential to the issue of how to indent properly, but are nonetheless worth mentioning because they’re another interpretation of the character. Rather than assign a fixed position for each tab stop, elastic tabstops auto-magically treats each tab as exactly wide as it needs to be for the text to remain aligned, taking into account the text and s on surrounding lines. This allows one to use s to align non-whitespace text while avoiding the issue we saw above where the tab stops had to be sufficiently far apart. I won’t delve into it, but if you’re interested you can read more here. When indenting, s and s serve different purposes. Indentation works best when both s and s are used, the former for semantic indentation and the latter for aesthetic indentation. Indenting with a fixed number of spaces takes us back to the days of the typewriter, when nothing was virtual, everything was physical, and horizontal space was horizontal space was horizontal space, alignment was alignment was alignment. We are in a more advanced age now and we don’t need to tie semantics to aesthetics quite so strongly; we can make use of the virtual facilities provided by computers to write more comfortably, and in a more individualized manner, than was allowed by typewriters. We listen to the music we like; we use the editors of our choosing; we use the syntax themes we like best; we assign keyboard shortcuts to the actions that make us most productive. But when it comes to the width of our indentation, we are told to all march in lockstep, not due to any technological limitation, but for the sake of some misbegotten notion of “consistency”. Even Guido van Rossum, dictator of Python and proponent of needless consistency,[8] could acknowledge that “A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds”. I think it’s high time that the rest of us do so as well. 1. Even if you are using a language whose dictator has decreed that you must use spaces for indentation, the logic still applies. If you are using such a language, you have my condolences. 2. I personally find Style 2 easier to read, but Style 1 brings more attention to the operators, so it’s a toss-up. In any case, the specifics of how you align your code aren’t important as long as you do so consistently. 3. Most, if not all, spreadsheet applications still use Tab to move to the next cell to the right. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. 4. While many “smart” editors will not blindly insert when Tab is pressed — Tab is just another key, and they’re free to respond to it how they want — most “dumb” editors like Apple’s TextEdit and Microsoft’s Notepad will. If your editor doesn’t insert the character when you press Tab, you might be able to force it to insert by pressing Ctrl+I. 5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems 6. Python’s PEP 8 simply says “Use 4 spaces per indentation level”. It does not state why this is optimal. 7. In addition, some IDEs have auto-formatting built right in. 8. Where “needless consistency” can be taken to mean his own personal preferences. Kudos to Mr. van Rossum for getting the world to adopt his personal preferences on code style as the “right” way to write one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Shame on the world for bowing to the whims of a dictator, benevolent or otherwise.","title":"Indenting with Tabs and Spaces","component":"blog","version":"","name":"mixing-indentation","url":"/blog/mixing-indentation","titles":[{"text":"Indentation: The Basics","hash":"_indentation_the_basics","id":1},{"text":"The Two Goals of Indentation","hash":"_the_two_goals_of_indentation","id":2},{"text":"A Brief History of the Tab Key","hash":"_a_brief_history_of_the_tab_key","id":3},{"text":"The Tab Character","hash":"_the_tab_character","id":4},{"text":"Virtual Tab Stops","hash":"_virtual_tab_stops","id":5},{"text":"Camp 1: Only Tabs","hash":"_camp_1_only_tabs","id":6},{"text":"Tabs for Semantic Indentation","hash":"_tabs_for_semantic_indentation","id":7},{"text":"Tabs for Aesthetic Indentation","hash":"_tabs_for_aesthetic_indentation","id":8},{"text":"Camp 2: Only Spaces","hash":"_camp_2_only_spaces","id":9},{"text":"Spaces for Aesthetic Indentation","hash":"_spaces_for_aesthetic_indentation","id":10},{"text":"Spaces for Semantic Indentation","hash":"_spaces_for_semantic_indentation","id":11},{"text":"Camp 0: (Responsibly) Mixing Tabs and Spaces","hash":"_camp_0_responsibly_mixing_tabs_and_spaces","id":12},{"text":"Editing in Practice","hash":"_editing_in_practice","id":13},{"text":"The Very Dumb Way","hash":"_the_very_dumb_way","id":14},{"text":"The Dumb Way","hash":"_the_dumb_way","id":15},{"text":"The Smart Way","hash":"_the_smart_way","id":16},{"text":"Other Practical Considerations","hash":"_other_practical_considerations","id":17},{"text":"Other Thoughts","hash":"_other_thoughts","id":18},{"text":"No Indentation At All","hash":"_no_indentation_at_all","id":19},{"text":"Elastic Tabstops","hash":"_elastic_tabstops","id":20},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":21}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"And never is not better than right now. While I will do my best to never use Python in another project of mine, there’s no doubt that it is generally well liked. In Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey, Python was the #4 most popular language/technology among all developers, a remarkable feat for a language that has zero presence on the web (the top three languages/technologies were JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL). In addition, Python was the #3 most “loved” language (developers who are using it wish to continue to do so) and the #1 most “wanted” language (developers who are not yet using it wish to start). For Python to be so popular, it clearly must have gotten a lot right. This article discusses why I aim to never use Python again; despite everything right with Python, there is too much wrong with it to continue using it. It’s not that Python has gotten worse (with the exception of PEP 635 — Structural Pattern Matching, an unmitigated disaster), but that the universe of other languages has gotten better while Python has stood still. In light of this, the first key result from that survey — “After a consistent rise over the last five years, Python fell from second last year to third this year on the list of most loved technologies…​” — is not surprising. Even though it declined in popularity last year, Python is still massively popular. It’s not hard to find praise for Python online, but I’ll summarize what I think are its greatest strengths here. Python operates at a level of abstraction that allows programmers to focus on the problem at hand while ignoring the implementation details of both computers and Python itself. Python is garbage collected and handles memory management for you. Everything, including functions and types, is an object and can be referenced and passed around freely. The obj.attr syntax is how you access anything’s attribute, regardless of what kind of object obj actually is. For instance, you don’t need to use obj::attr in the event that obj is a type, namespace, module, etc. Iteration “just works”. (I think this was a bigger deal in the early 1990’s when Python was first released; now we take simple iteration for granted. But I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s because Python showed that there was a right way to do it, which everyone subsequently copied.) Importing packages “just works” and the imported module acts like any other Python object. Heck, you can even import antigravity. The relation between syntax and methods is clear and extendable to your own types. If you want to be able to add your objects together as in x + y, just define __add__(self, other). Compare this to, say, Java, in which + may only be used on the primitive numeric types, e.g., even though BigInteger feels like a regular number, it must use x.add(y) because it is a “real” type. There is a Python package for everything. As long as performance is not an issue, you will never need to leave the Python ecosystem. The standard library is huge (a.k.a. “batteries included”), so for simple scripts you likely don’t even need to install external packages. Python has been around forever and has been used a ton. On Stack Overflow, there are currently 1,756,625 questions with the python tag. For comparison, there are 361,664 questions tagged with C, 731,016 tagged with C++, 1,787,947 tagged with Java, and 2,242,203 tagged with JavaScript. If you have a Python question, chances are that it’s been asked and answered already. In addition, it is nearly guaranteed that your editor/IDE has superb Python support. It’s very handy to be able to (re-)evaluate code on the fly. Combined with introspection, this lets you explore unfamiliar territory quickly. Before I get into the next section, it’s important to recognize that from a technological standpoint, Python is amazing. A language that’s easy to write, easy to reason about, and can call down to C when performance is important? Without a doubt, it is one of the modern marvels of (software) engineering. But, for all the good ideas present in Python, many of which have percolated into the wider world of programming languages, it is saddled with too many bad ideas for me to continue using it. Of course, practicality dictates that Python is not going anywhere anytime soon; it has been used in countless projects, and the principle of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” holds. But if you can avoid using Python for future work, you should. Here is why. Pip, Python’s built-in package installer, is notoriously fickle and confusing to use. Common questions include: Should you use pip install or python3 -m pip install? (When) should you use sudo with pip? How about the --user flag? (When) is there a difference between pip and pip3? How important is it to know about setuptools? distutils? In addition to installing packages, it is also important to be able to manage Python virtual environments. Python’s official docs recommend that you use virtualenv for this, and if the Python ecosystem worked correctly, this would be the end of the story. To add to the confusion, the name of the package is virtualenv if you’re on Python 3.2 or older, but venv in Python 3.3 and newer, and it comes bundled with Python 3.3 and newer, but for Python 3.2 or older you need to run python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv. At least that answers two of the questions above! To see the chaos that is the Python package management ecosystem, visit this page. Note that this only covers those tools that conform to the PyPA specifications! In the void that Python has left, several third-party projects for managing packages and environments have been developed, each with their own pros, cons, and instructions. In general, they are not interoperable, so you have to pick one and hope it serves your needs. Below is a list of the most popular ones with descriptions taken from their home pages. Conda Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. One of the first Python package managers that really took off, especially among data scientists, it’s well-supported by third-party software such as IDEs. It is completely separate from Python’s package ecosystem — it hosts packages in its own repository separate from PyPI, the repo used by pip. This means it tends not to have the more niche Python packages. To add to the confusion, though, conda can use pip to install packages from PyPI packages, but installing from Conda’s repo is preferred. Pipenv Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. Rather than reinvent the wheel, Pipenv automates the use of Python’s builtin package management tools. virtualenvwrapper virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking’s virtualenv tool. The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies. For some reason virtualenv needs a wrapper? Go figure. Poetry Develop Poetry comes with all the tools you might need to manage your projects in a deterministic way. Build Easily build and package your projects with a single command. Publish Make your work known by publishing it to PyPI. Track Having an insight of your project’s dependencies is just one command away. Dependency resolver Poetry comes with an exhaustive dependency resolver, which will always find a solution if it exists. Isolation Poetry either uses your configured virtualenvs or creates its own to always be isolated from your system. Intuitive CLI Poetry’s commands are intuitive and easy to use, with sensible defaults while still being configurable. Before I swore off Python, this was the package manager I used (after getting tired of Conda’s dependency solver taking ages to finish). It worked great, although it took some finagling to get it to work with VS Code. That’s one of the issues with having a million tools that do the same thing — whether the tool you want to use will be well-supported by others is a matter of luck. Evidently, Python has not done a good enough job at package management to stave off competing projects. While Python cannot be blamed for not getting package and environment management correct at the outset, it very much can be blamed for letting it get to this point and continuing to drop the ball on this front. Compare this to Rust, which has a single package and environment manager, Cargo, which is so good that nobody has bothered trying to make a better one. Java has two or three predominant package managers, Ruby has a single one, I’ll wrap up this section with a quote from Python’s own docs: Packaging in Python has a bit of a reputation for being a bumpy ride. This impression is mostly a byproduct of Python’s versatility. Once you understand the natural boundaries between each packaging solution, you begin to realize that the varied landscape is a small price Python programmers pay for using one of the most balanced, flexible languages available. I don’t know, I’m not buying it. Python has two style guides: PEP 8 — Style Guide for Python Code, which deals with stylistic choices when literally writing code, and PEP 20 — The Zen of Python, which deals with how best to design an entire program, predominantly from a logic standpoint. Together, these form the definitive guide to how best use Python to accomplish one’s goals while maintaining consistency with the greater Python ecosystem. Here is the text of PEP 20, which you can print in a Python REPL with import this. The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! In theory, these principles are great. In practice, Python breaks most of them and encourages you to do the same. “Pythonic” code is not necessarily code that is easy to read. Contrary to the notion that Python is beginner-friendly, understanding Pythonic code often requires familiarity with both Python and the codebase you’re reading. What follows are several examples of these issues. Function names According to PEP 8, “Function [and variable and method] names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Variable names follow the same convention as function names.” Yet several of Python’s built-in function names do not separate words with underscores: isinstance, classmethod/staticmethod, setattr, and str.startswith come to mind. Even as recently as version 3.9, Python introduced new methods that broke this rule, str.removeprefix and str.removesuffix. Class/type names According to PEP 8, “class names should normally use the CapWords convention.” Of course, Python’s own built-in classes such as int, float, str, list, and dict are exempt from this. The PEP says that “there is a separate convention for builtin names”; it makes no attempt to justify this decision. Some classes that ship with the Python standard library, but which are not builtins, are written in all lowercase while others are written as CapWords, such as collections.namedtuple and collections.deque and collections.Counter and colletions.ChainMap. Constant names According to PEP 8, “Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.” Not only do True, False, and None break this rule, but they’re written in CapWords, the style of class names instead of the more sensible all lowercase, the style of variable names. Yet Python encourages you to “use the fact that empty sequences are false”: # Correct: if not seq: if seq: # Wrong: if len(seq): if not len(seq): This doesn’t seem very explicit to me. If I expect seq to be a sequence, then I should signal to other readers that that is my intention, as if seq would also treat 0 and None as false whereas len(0) and len(None) would both be both runtime errors. Furthermore, treating non-Boolean values as Booleans is the height of implicitness; being explicit would mean typing if len(seq) == 0, if x == 0, if x is None, etc. These all specify exactly the condition I am looking for in the most explicit way possible, yet their use is discouraged by Python’s own docs. You are also encouraged to check if a variable is None with if x is None instead of if x == None. Implicit in this is the knowledge that NoneType is a singleton type — that all instances of NoneType refer to the same object, called None, of which there is only one. Checking for equality with is instead of == is almost always the wrong thing to do, yet here Python tells us it’s right, relying on implicit knowledge to justify that decision. Another example of this is that raise MyException is legal, even though MyException is of type type, not Exception. Why is this? It’s because passing a type to raise will instantiate an instance of that type by calling the type’s constructor with no arguments. Not very explicit, and all to save a pair of parentheses. If the real motivation behind this decision is to be able to defer the instantiation of the exception until it is definitely needed in case the exception is expensive to construct, then one could ask why not allow any callable to be raised — why must it be a (callable) subtype of Exception? lambda: MyException() seems much more explicit to me. PEP 20 (implicitly!) prohibits footguns. Consider the following code. What do you think it will print? L = [(lambda: i) for i in range(5)] print([f() for f in L]) Click to reveal answer It will print [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The is in the comprehension are captured by the lambdas, survive beyond the lifetime of the comprehension, and are only resolved when actually calling f(). At that time, they all resolve to 4 — even though the comprehension doesn’t exist anymore! How many rules does this break?","title":"When It Comes to Ditching Python, Now is Better than Never","component":"blog","version":"","name":"python-is-bad","url":"/blog/python-is-bad","titles":[{"text":"Python’s Popularity","hash":"_pythons_popularity","id":1},{"text":"What Python Does Right","hash":"_what_python_does_right","id":2},{"text":"Abstraction","hash":"_abstraction","id":3},{"text":"Package ecosystem","hash":"_package_ecosystem","id":4},{"text":"Huge community and wide support","hash":"_huge_community_and_wide_support","id":5},{"text":"It’s interpreted and has a REPL","hash":"_its_interpreted_and_has_a_repl","id":6},{"text":"What Python Does Wrong","hash":"_what_python_does_wrong","id":7},{"text":"Package management","hash":"_package_management","id":8},{"text":"Python breaks its own rules.","hash":"_python_breaks_its_own_rules","id":9},{"text":"Names","hash":"_names","id":10},{"text":"“Explicit is better than implicit”","hash":"_explicit_is_better_than_implicit","id":11},{"text":"Footguns","hash":"_footguns","id":12}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"In the before-times, formatting code was something of an art. One is supposed to indent code correctly to make its structure clear to the reader, and in some instances align it to be aesthetically pleasing, but historically this has been laborious. So, sometimes people didn’t do it, or, because they were human, didn’t do it correctly. Guido van Rossum, the creator and benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) of Python, had the bright idea to force programmers to correctly indent their code by making indentation the sole indicator of scope. While most languages used braces to delineate scope, with indentation merely a visual aide for humans, Python decided to nix the braces and imbue indentation with semantics. This was a terrible decision that has made editing Python code much more difficult than other languages. My concern here is not with the lack of braces per se, but rather with the use of whitespace instead of beginning and ending delimiters (of any kind). For instance, Ruby writes if-else statements as if …​ else …​ end. This is fine; like brace-delimited languages, Ruby does not depend on indentation to interpret this because it has the end keyword. For simplicity, I’ll refer to any kind of non-whitespace delimiters as “braces”. When cutting and pasting your own code or copying and pasting code from the internet, it’s difficult to make sure the indentation of the pasted code matches that of the surrounding code. Some examples of problematic scenarios: The indent level of the copied code and the region you wish to paste it into aren’t the same. They are the same, but you forgot to copy the leading whitespace of the code and pasted into column 0, so the first line is under-indented. They are the same, and you copied the leading whitespace of the code, but pasted into the rightmost column of the current line instead of into column 0, so now the first line is over-indented. The code you’re pasting uses tabs when your own code uses spaces, or vice versa. (To determine the indentation level, Python simply counts the number of leading whitespace characters on a line, with some limitations on what combinations of whitespace are allowed.) The code you copied off the internet was itself mis-indented — a common formatting error due to Markdown’s four-space-indent syntax for code blocks — so now you must correct its indentation yourself. Therefore, immediately after pasting, it’s possible that the indentation of the pasted code does not correctly reflect the intended semantics. In a brace-delimited language, this would be fine because indentation does not affect the semantics of the code. But in Python, copy-pastes have the potential to become exercises in memory and precision — after pasting, one must make sure to indent or dedent the pasted code, and only the pasted code, to the correct level. If this is not performed correctly, then hopefully the code will cease to compile, but it’s equally likely that a bug will have been introduced. Python has taken a simple, ubiquitous textual operation — one which brace-delimited languages make nearly impossible to mess up — and made it arduous and error-prone. Now, one might say, “It’s all well and good that brace-delimited languages can withstand poor indentation, but what value does this have if poorly formatted code is forbidden (by company policy, say) from existing in one’s codebase? Won’t I still have to correct the formatting manually?”. But we no longer live in the before-times, when code formatting was an art; it has been elevated to a science by auto-formatters, technology that can format our code for us! You can give Prettier, a popular JavaScript autoformatter, a try here. The unformatted code on the left side is a mess. But the (automatically!) formatted code on the right side looks great. (And crucially, as far as a computer is concerned, the two sides are identical.) It would take a lot of work to consistently write such well-formatted code. If you’re not happy with how the formatted code looks using the default settings, you can change them in the left panel. What’s notable is that the code on the left was able to be automatically formatted even though the poor formatting meant its semantics were not clear to a human; all that was required by the auto-formatter was that the code be understandable to a computer. And in turn, this means that the human author has free reign to absolutely butcher the layout of their code while writing it because once they’re done, the autoformatter will swoop in and clean it up for them. Here are some examples of where Python’s use of whitespace-based syntax makes it much harder to edit than brace-delimited languages. You place your cursor at the end of the line, delete to the start of the line, and then begin typing. In a brace-delimited language, you can just start typing in column 0, press “format”, and the line will be automatically re-indented to the correct column. This is not possible in Python because text in column 0 carries semantics with it, so moving it would change the program’s semantics. Python makes it the programmer’s responsibility to indent the new text to the same level as the old text. You comment out an if statement in order to execute the code below it unconditionally. In a brace-delimited language, you just comment out the line containing the if (or the lines between the if and the opening brace if the condition spans multiple lines) and the line containing the closing brace. If you do this and press “format”, all the code inside the former if statement will be automatically dedented to account for the change. Of course, because indentation doesn’t matter, there is no harm in not pressing “format”. In Python, if you comment out the if line, then you must additionally dedent all of the code that was inside the if statement. If you decide to uncomment the if line, then you need to reindent all those same lines again. If you miss a line, it’s a bug. You are using Vim and you want to delete an entire block. In a brace-delimited languages, this is as easy as typing di{ (mnemonic: delete inside {}). This isn’t possible in Python because there are no block delimiters. You wish to comment out an entire block. In a brace-delimited language, you just comment out each line of the block and nothing will break. In Python, blocks can’t be empty, so you have to add pass in place of the block. Code wrapping According to PEP 8, lines should be no longer than 79 characters. This is the justification given: The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines. Yes, if you rely on whitespace to interpret code, then soft wraps will make it impossible to figure out what a given piece of code does. In a brace delimited language, you can easily make sense of a wrapped line because the wrapping doesn’t affect semantics — you can just look for matching braces. This is especially easy if your editor makes matching braces stand out by highlighting them, coloring them, etc. It is much harder to make indentation stand out. You have commented out some code, and now wish to uncomment it. In a brace-delimited language, this is trivial; just uncomment and then autoformat. Python has auto-formatters too, the most popular of which are autopep8, yapf, and black. By default, auto-formatters will format comments, indenting them to the level of the surrounding code. This makes sense when those comments contain ordinary text describing the surrounding code. But if those comments contain commented out code, then when it comes time to uncomment that code, you must ensure that the uncommented code gets indented back to the right level. In other words, Python forces you to be mindful of leading spaces, even in your comments. For instance, suppose we have the following code, but wish to check a different condition. if cond1: print(\"a\") So we comment out line 1 and add a different condition: if cond2: # let's test out cond2 for now # if cond1: print(\"a\") Now, black will turn that into this: if cond2: # let's test cond2 out for now # if cond1: print(\"a\") And if you want to swap cond1 back in, you get this: # if cond2: # let's test cond2 out for now if cond1: print(\"a\") which is not valid code. Yes, you can manually dedent line 2, or you could have added the cond2 line below cond1 instead of above. But how much effort and attention should these kinds of simple changes really take? In a brace-delimited language such as JavaScript, that flow would look like this: You start with this…​ if (cond1) { console.log(\"a\"); } You want to test a different condition…​ if (cond2) { // let's test cond2 out for now // if (cond1) { console.log(\"a\"); } Then you autoformat…​ if (cond2) { // let's test cond2 out for now // if (cond1) { console.log(\"a\"); } Then you swap cond1 back in and get this…​ // if (cond2) { // let's test cond2 out for now if (cond1) { console.log(\"a\"); } Then you autoformat again. // if (cond2) { // let's test cond2 out for now if (cond1) { console.log(\"a\"); } Success! There’s no need to fiddle with anything. In summary, whitespace-based syntax makes the act of actually writing one’s code much more difficult than it needs to be. While tying semantics to leading indentation may have been beneficial when Python was first released, auto-formatters have obviated this benefit. In fact, whitespace-based syntax is a liability because it makes it harder for auto-formatters to do their job. There is one kind of whitespace-based syntax that is ok, which is using line breaks to denote the end of a line. If, in practice, the editing process made it a natural occurrence to inadvertently end up with several statements on one line, then I would argue that languages should require semicolons at the ends of their lines. But, empirically, the editing process does not generally mangle line breaks, so they can be relied upon for semantics. (In this regard, newlines are closer to non-whitespace characters than they are to whitespace.) Leading whitespace is mangled by the editing process and so it should not be relied upon.","title":"Brackets, Braces, Tabs, and Spaces: The Harms of Whitespace-Based Syntax","component":"blog","version":"","name":"whitespace-based-syntax","url":"/blog/whitespace-based-syntax","titles":[{"text":"Whitespace-based syntax","hash":"_whitespace_based_syntax","id":1},{"text":"Pasting Code","hash":"_pasting_code","id":2},{"text":"Auto-formatters","hash":"_auto_formatters","id":3},{"text":"Editing in practice","hash":"_editing_in_practice","id":4}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"This page is a portal to other GitHub pages of mine: Collagen: The Collage Generator rben01/collagen Collagen is a program that takes as input a folder containing zero or more image files (.jpeg, .png, etc.) and a JSON manifest file describing the layout of these images along with SVG components such as shapes and text, and produces as output a single SVG file with all assets embedded.

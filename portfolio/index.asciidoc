== Projects

=== Collagen

[.repo-link]##{github-site}/{clgn-repo}[icon:github[]{clgn-repo}]##

Collagen is a program that takes as input a folder containing zero or more image files
(`.jpeg`, `.png`, etc.) and a JSON manifest file describing the layout of these images
along with SVG components such as shapes and text, and produces as output a single SVG
file with all assets embedded.
I started this project because I was frustrated by the widespread rasterization of vector graphics and inappropriate use of image formats (using JPEG when a PNG should have been used, or vice versa) and set out to do something about it.

A very, very young project -- hardly any docs or tests (yet!) -- which is currently just a MVP.
Stay tuned!

=== COVID-19 Tracker


link:https://rben01.github.io/covid19/[COVID-19/Coronavirus Tracker] — [.repo-link]##{repo-covid}[icon:github[]{name-covid}]##

// {repo-covid}[{github-icon-in-link}]{repo-covid}[{name-covid}]

A collection of graphs displaying how coronavirus has spread throughout the world and in particular throughout the US.
The data was ingested with {resource-link-pandas} and the graphs and interactivity were built with {resource-link-d3}.
Last update to the data was in March (due to the data source shutting down), but the site still works fine.

== Interactive Math and Science Demonstrations

Working at the World Science Festival, I have produced a number interactive demonstrations that aim to elucidate mathematical and/or scientific principles.
These demonstrations, written in HTML+CSS+JS and utilizing the {resource-link-d3} and {resource-link-threejs} libraries, aim to make complex mathematical and physical principles more accessible to anyone interested in science.

Demos are listed below.
Those marked with a {demo-marker} icon are particularly complex, impressive, or just plain cool.

(Quantum mechanics asserts that an object's momentum wavefunction is the Fourier transform of its position wavefunction.)

A particle in a finite potential well, such as an electron bound to an atom, can only exist at a discrete set of energy levels, which are the solutions to the Schrödinger equation in that well.
This demo shows the permissible energy levels and the wavefunction at each of those energy levels.
_Because the Schrödinger equation in a finite well cannot be solved exactly, this demo required implementing a numerical solver in JavaScript to determine the permissible energy levels._

_Sampling from an arbitrary probability distribution required numeric approximation and integration of the plotted wavefunction's curve._

=== Special Relativity

All special relativity demos are available link:https://worldscienceu.com/courses/special-relativity-world-science-u/[here] -- look for the "Demonstration" lessons.
None of them get a {demo-marker}.

=== Math

* {demo-marker} link:https://worldscienceu.com/lessons/1-3-truth-and-beauty-conic-sections/[Conic sections], demonstrating how conic sections can be expressed as the intersection of a plane and an infinite double-cone.
* link:https://worldscienceu.com/lessons/4-3-non-euclidean-geometry/[Non-Euclidean geometry], showing how flat and curved spaces can be differentiated by the sum of the angles of a triangle drawn on their surface.

=== Other

* {demo-marker} link:https://worldscienceu.com/lessons/2-4-particles-and-fields-demonstration/[World line], demonstrating John Wheeler's concept of the one-electron universe.
The neat thing in this demo is that if you draw a random world line, a random, nice-looking (i.e., smooth, devoid of kinks) curve is procedurally generated.
Making this randomly drawn curve look nice was quite challenging.

This was predominantly an exercise in tweaking animation paths and timing curves.

* link:https://worldscienceu.com/lessons/2-3-negative-energy-density-approximate-size-of-the-now-observable-universe-during-inflation/[Inflation in the early universe], showing how rapidly the universe expanded in its first 10^−37^ seconds of existence.

== Blog

Just one blog post for now, but I'm happy enough with both the content and the design to add it here.

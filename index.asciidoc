This page is a portal to other GitHub pages of mine:

https://rben01.github.io/covid19/[COVID-19/Coronavirus Tracker]::
[.repo-link]##{repo-covid}[icon:github[]{name-covid}]## +
A collection of graphs displaying how coronavirus has spread throughout the world and in particular throughout the US. +
The data was ingested with {resource-link-pandas}, the graphics were built with {resource-link-d3}, and the site itself was written with {resource-link-asciidoctor}.

{url-trivia-page}[Quarantine Trivia]::
[.repo-link]##{repo-trivia}[icon:github[]{name-trivia}]## +
A collection of trivia games I put together to give friends something to play while hanging out virtually during the coronavirus pandemic. The games are available {url-trivia-page}[here].
